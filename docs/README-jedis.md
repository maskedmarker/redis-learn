Jedis provides a simple API for connecting to and interacting with Redis, including commands for common Redis operations 
like adding, retrieving, and deleting data, as well as advanced Redis features such as transactions, pipelining, and pub/sub.


Key Features of Jedis:

Simple and Lightweight:
Jedis is designed to be simple and straightforward to use. It provides an easy-to-understand, Java-friendly API to interact with Redis.

Connection Pooling:
Jedis supports connection pooling out-of-the-box using JedisPool. This allows for better management of Redis connections in multi-threaded applications, improving performance and resource management.

Full Redis Command Support:
Jedis supports almost all Redis commands, such as SET, GET, DEL, HSET, HGET, LPUSH, LRANGE, PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE, and many more.

Pipeline Support:
Jedis provides support for pipelining, which allows you to send multiple commands to Redis without waiting for responses, improving performance for bulk operations.

Transactions:
Jedis supports Redis transactions, allowing you to execute a series of commands atomically with MULTI, EXEC, and WATCH commands.

Cluster Support:
Jedis also provides support for Redis clusters, allowing it to work with Redis instances distributed across multiple nodes, which is useful for large-scale applications.
